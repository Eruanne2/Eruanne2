### Hi, I'm Charis 👋

💻 I'm a full-stack developer who specializes in React-Redux and Ruby on Rails.

❤️ Check out my favorite project, [Align Bank](https://align-financial.herokuapp.com/#/)! It's a clone of real-life Ally Bank, which is fully functional including some pretty nifty features like interest accrual and force logout after inactivity.

📈 I also had a blast making [TracNova](https://trac-nova.herokuapp.com/), a habit tracker that looks for correlations between multiple habits or factors. 

🛠️ Right now I'm building a rotating [Earth Observatory](https://github.com/Eruanne2/epic-earth) that allows you to see what Earth looked like on any given day, using photos taken by NASA'S Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera. (Hint: check out Feb 11, 2021 to see something cool!) 🚀

💭 The next project I'm planning is a mini game I will be building with my friend Lamar.

🇰🇷  I am also learning Korean! 남편은 공군 조종사이고  남편하고 함께 군산에 살고 있어요.

🚵 I'm passionate about personal finance, physical fitness, and pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone in every way possible.

📬 Reach out to me at charis.ginn222@gmail.com if you'd like to collaborate!
