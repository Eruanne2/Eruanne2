### Hi, I'm Charis 👋

💻 I'm a full-stack developer who specializes in React-Redux and Ruby on Rails.

❤️ Check out my favorite project, [TracNova](https://trac-nova.herokuapp.com/)! It's a habit tracker that looks for correlations between multiple habits or factors. 

💰 I'm also very proud of [Align Bank](https://align-financial.herokuapp.com/#/), my clone of real-life Ally Bank, which is fully functional including some pretty nifty features like interest accrual and force logout after inactivity.

🛠️ Right now I'm wrapping up a [script](https://github.com/Eruanne2/WX-Alerts) that texts my husband whenever there is a major weather event in any of his 8 favorite places. (He likes weather, don't ask me why 🤷‍♀️)

💭 The next project I'm planning will be a spin on Benjamin Torvaney's [Duck Debugger](https://torvaney.github.io/projects/duck-debugger) using Python and Django.

🇰🇷  I'm currently learning Korean, as I will be moving to South Korea this summer! 안녕하세요! 군산에서 살게요.

🚵 I'm passionate about personal finance, physical fitness, and pushing the boundaries of my comfort zone in every way possible.

📬 Reach out to me at charis.ginn222@gmail.com if you'd like to collaborate!
