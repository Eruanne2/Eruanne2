### Hi, I'm Charis 👋

💻: I'm a full-stack developer who specializes in React-Redux and Ruby on Rails.

❤️ Check out my favorite project, [TracNova](https://trac-nova.herokuapp.com/)! It's a habit tracker that looks for correlations between multiple habits or factors. 

🛠️ Right now I'm working on a Time Value of Money Visualizer. Check out the live link [here](https://eruanne2.github.io/Time-Value-of-Money-Visualizer/).

💭 The next project on my radar is a spin on Benjamin Torvaney's [Duck Debugger](https://torvaney.github.io/projects/duck-debugger). 

🇰🇷  I'm currently learning Korean, as I will be moving to South Korea this summer! 안녕하세요! 군산에서 살게요.

🚵 I'm passionate about personal finance, physical fitness, and outdoor exploration.

📬 Reach out to me at charis.ginn222@gmail.com if you'd like to collaborate!
